This is a sample dataset that contains deliberately introduced anomalies for demonstration purposes. The treatment group rows are out of sequence (ID numbers 9, 7, 6, 10, 8) which would typically indicate manual row manipulation.

This sample can be used to see how the application detects and highlights potential data manipulation patterns.
